# Security Policy

### Supported Versions

We release updates for the Archivon documentation and code samples site as needed. Security fixes are applied to the current maintained version.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

**Archivon** takes security seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it privately so we can address it before any public disclosure.

**How to report.** Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. Send an email to **corporationarchivon@gmail.com**. Include a clear description of the issue, steps to reproduce (if applicable), impact assessment (if you can), and your name or handle if you wish to be credited.

**What to expect.** We will acknowledge receipt of your report as soon as possible. We will keep you informed of the progress and any fix or decision. We may ask for additional details to reproduce or validate the issue.

**Scope.** This project is a static documentation site (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). In scope are XSS, insecure handling of user or dynamic content, unsafe links, and any issue that could affect visitors. Out of scope are issues in third-party sites we link to, or in tools used only for local development (e.g. `live-server`).

Thank you for helping keep Archivon and its users safe.
