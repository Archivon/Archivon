# Contributing to Archivon

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Archivon**. Below are guidelines to help you get started.

## Contact

The company is **Archivon** and you can reach us at **corporationarchivon@gmail.com**. For questions about contributing, suggesting features, or reporting bugs, contact us by email.

## How to Contribute

**Reporting bugs or suggesting features.** Send a clear description to **corporationarchivon@gmail.com**, or open an issue on the repository if the project is hosted on GitHub. For bugs, include steps to reproduce and, if possible, browser and OS. For features, describe the idea and why it would be useful.

**Code and content contributions.** If applicable, fork and clone the repository and create a branch for your change (e.g. `fix/typo-docs`, `feature/new-sample`). Follow the existing style: keep HTML, CSS and JS consistent with the current structure; keep functions and files small and avoid duplication; use the existing sanitization for any dynamic content (see `js/sanitize.js`). Test locally with `npm run dev` and check the pages you changed. Then submit your changes (patch, pull request, or email with a clear description of what you changed).

**Documentation and code samples.** New docs go under `docs/`; new code samples are added in `js/samples-data.js` and can have a corresponding view. Use clear titles and structure and keep samples focused and safe (no unsafe `innerHTML` without escaping).

**Code of Conduct.** By participating, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We appreciate your time and effort. If you prefer to contribute by email, send your ideas or patches to **corporationarchivon@gmail.com**.
